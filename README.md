# Linked List in Java

>#### linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.Here I used Hashmap for maping every node of the list sequentially.

 * User can add Head Node.
 * Every next node is related to its previous node. 
 * If the next node space it already filled then no new node can be placed for the targeted node.Then it will throw exception.
